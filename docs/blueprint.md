- Wellness Token Rewards: Earn non-transferable Wellness Tokens for positive mental health habits, redeemable for discounts on counseling or subscriptions.
- Mood Logging and Tracking: Allow users to log their moods and track their emotional state over time. Data visualization tools can assist in noticing longer term patterns.
